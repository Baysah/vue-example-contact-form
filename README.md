Vue.js Example Contact Form
---------------------------

[VueJS Contact Form Example](http://jcottrell.github.io/vue-example-contact-form/)

See the index.html file for the form and connections to the vue.js file.

See the vue.js file for the "app".

I tried to comment heavily on both files, including some challenges / next steps in the vue.js file.

All the other includes are pulled in from various CDNs to keep the number of files limited to the only ones you'll probably change to get an idea of Vue.
